Congratulations on your accomplishment! Here's a draft of a paragraph you could use to describe this project on your portfolio website:

JWord: A Localized Wordle Game Clone in Java

In a thrilling challenge of my programming skills, I built JWord, a localized version of the popular online word puzzle game, Wordle. Fully implemented in Java, JWord selects a new 5-letter target word with each game, providing an exciting guessing challenge for the player. I utilized the Swing library for the graphical user interface, enabling a visually engaging game experience that does not require any internet services or social media integration.

My design strategy for JWord placed emphasis on both functionality and robustness. I worked meticulously to ensure the game correctly handled any incorrect inputs and maintained stability throughout gameplay. Additionally, I extended the basic game implementation by introducing novel features that enhanced the overall playability and enjoyment of the game.

JWord's code base reflects the best practices of modularity and quality, making it easy to understand, debug, and maintain. The game also includes a dictionary of 5-letter English words and a subset of target words, eliminating archaic or unusual spellings for a fairer play experience.

This project not only allowed me to deepen my understanding of Java and Swing but also honed my skills in developing interactive applications that balance aesthetics and functionality, creating a delightful user experience.
